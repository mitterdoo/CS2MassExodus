# Mass Exodus
This is just a silly mod that makes every Cim want to move out of your city. It's pretty fun watching traffic and public transportation grind to a halt.

There are no settings. If this mod is enabled, any city you load will have its Cims move out.

Kudos to [algernon](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/p/algernon/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/algernon-A/)) for laying some of the modding ground work in their other CS2 mods published here. Hopefully I did the copyright stuff correctly. Some code and techniques were borrowed from algernon's [Line Tool Lite](https://github.com/algernon-A/LineToolLite) mod. Please reach out to me on the Cities: Skylines Modding Discord (username `ranthos`) if I've done the credits incorrectly.

(Yes, I know the population count doesn't update)
